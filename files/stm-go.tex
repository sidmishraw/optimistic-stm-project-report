  \section{STM in Go}

  \par
  This section discusses the implementation of the STM prototype in {\em Go}. I made some changes to the design of the STM and the execution workflow (from \ref{exec-workflow}). The changes were made to get {\em Haskell}'s {\em Monad} styled builder pattern for my {\em transactions} and an easy to use API.
